# Lame Neuronal Network
Dirty as hay, learn python with this file at your own risks.

Heavily based on "The Independent Code" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pauPCy_s0Ok


## The scrip
Initiate a very small Neuronal Network, and train it to resolve a XOR logic table.

## How to use install?

### Classic python install
Install Python >=3.7
Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
You should be able to run the script by using "python Test_XOR.py"

### Windows executable
Not yet available


## How to use?
By now, only "python Test_XOR.py" works.


## Future work
No garanty of future work.
See "TODO.txt".
But, basically, libify the network to make it easier to use, and add saving/loading of trained network.
In the future, probably a C boilerplate inference too.
Again, no guaranties.
